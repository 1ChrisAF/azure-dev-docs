# Tutorial: Clean up Azure resources

The various Azure resources you created in this tutorial can incur ongoing costs. To clean them up, it's best to visit [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), select **Resource groups** from the left-side navigation pane, select the resource group that was created in the process of this tutorial, and then use the **Delete resource group** command.
