Document the hardware (memory, CPU, disk) of the current production server(s) as well as the average and peak request counts and resource utilization.  This information must inform the choice of VM size.  See the [Azure Documentation for virtual machine sizing](/azure/cloud-services/cloud-services-sizes-specs).
