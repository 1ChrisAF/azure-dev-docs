### Determine whether Management over REST is used

If the lifecycle of your application includes using Management over REST, you need to capture which ports are used to access the REST API and how they are authenticated and exposed. After migration, you'll need to ensure these same ports and authentication mechanisms are exposed so your application lifecycle can operate in a similar fashion as before the migration. See [Management over REST in the Oracle documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/middleware/12213/wls/WLRUR/title.htm).
