### Document datasources

If your application uses any databases, you need to capture the following information:

1. What is the datasource name?
2. What is the connection pool configuration?
3. Where can I find the JDBC driver JAR file?

For more information on JDBC drivers in WebLogic, see [Using JDBC Drivers with WebLogic Server](https://docs.oracle.com/middleware/1213/wls/JDBCA/third_party_drivers.htm#JDBCA231).
