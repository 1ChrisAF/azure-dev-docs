# Choosing the right command-line tool for Azure

When it comes to managing Azure, knowing which tool to use can be confusing.

[Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli), [Azure PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/azure/install-az-ps), and [Azure Cloud Shell](http://shell.azure.com/) all have overlapping functionality. Because each operates differently, it's
difficult to determine which is the right tool to use.

In this article, you'll learn how to choose the right tool for you.

## Azure CLI vs Azure PowerShell

Azure CLI and Azure PowerShell are command-line tools that create and manage Azure resources. Both are cross-platform, installable
on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

**Azure CLI**

* Cross-platform command-line interface, installable on Windows, macOS, Linux
* Requires Windows PowerShell, Cmd, or Bash

**Azure PowerShell**

* Cross-platform PowerShell module, runs on Windows, macOS, Linux
* Requires Windows PowerShell or PowerShell

**Azure Cloud Shell**

* Cloud-hosted scripting shell that contains both AzureCLI and Azure PowerShell
* Accessible via a web browser or attachable to local shell environments

## Different Shell Environments

|Shell Environment|Azure CLI|Azure PowerShell|
|---|:---:|:---:|
|Cmd|Yes||
|Bash|Yes|
|Windows PowerShell|Yes|Yes|
|PowerShell|Yes|Yes|

Windows PowerShell, PowerShell, Cmd, and Bash are shells environments. Your shell environment not only determines which tools you can use but also changes the experience.

For example, Bash uses backslashes `\` and Windows PowerShell uses backticks `` ` `` as a line continuation character. The differences in the shell environment don't change how Azure CLI and Azure PowerShell operate. However, they do change your command-line experience.

Azure CLI has an installer that makes its commands executable in all four shell environments.

Azure PowerShell is a PowerShell module named `Az`, not an executable. It can only be installed using Windows PowerShell or PowerShell. Windows PowerShell is the standard scripting shell that comes preinstalled with most Windows operating systems. PowerShell is a stand-alone installation that uses .NET Core as it's run time, allowing it to be (cross-platform), installable on macOS, Linux, and Windows.

Azure Cloud Shell is a hosted shell environment that runs on an Ubuntu container. Providing a Bash or PowerShell shell environment. Azure CLI and Azure PowerShell come preinstalled along with other command-line tools.

Customizations of Azure Cloud Shell are limited and you rely on Microsoft to update the version of the tooling provided.

**NOTE**:

* AzureRM is a PowerShell module that is still referenced for Azure administration with PowerShell. However, it has been replaced by Azure PowerShell and has an official retire date of February 29 2024.

## Which is right for you?

When picking the right tool, it's useful to consider your past experience and current work environment.

Azure CLI is similar to Bash scripting. If you work primarily with Linux systems, Azure CLI is going to feel more natural. Its commands are shorter and the syntax is
similar to that of Bash scripting.

Azure PowerShell is a PowerShell module. If you work primarily with Windows systems, Azure PowerShell is a natural fit. Commands follow a verb-noun naming scheme and
data is returned as objects.

Choose the tool that uses your experience. But also factor in your current work environment. Doing so will shorten the learning curve. And help you become proficient at managing Azure at the command line.

With that said, exercising a growth mindset will only improve your abilities. Use a different tool when it makes sense.

**Note**:

* Feature parity for Azure services doesn't always exist between Azure CLI and Azure PowerShell. But, new functionality is constantly being added.

Note:

* Azure CLI defaults to outputting a JSON string. Other format options can be found on the [Output formats for Azure CLI commands](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/format-output-azure-cli).
* Azure PowerShell defaults to outputting objects. To learn more about formatting in PowerShell read the [Using Format Commands to Change Output View](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/scripting/samples/using-format-commands-to-change-output-view).
