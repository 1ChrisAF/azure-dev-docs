# AI-powered Azure Cognitive Search for mobile application development

[Azure Cognitive Search](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/search) is a cloud search service with built-in AI capabilities. Cognitive Search gives developers APIs and tools for adding a rich search experience over private, heterogeneous content in web, mobile, and enterprise applications.

Your client can define the search experience by using Cognitive Search. Queries execute over a persisted index that you create, own, and store in your service.

Custom code invokes data ingestion indexing to create and load an index. Your application code issues query requests and handles responses.

## Azure Cognitive Search features

- **Freeform text search** with full text search, simple query syntax, and Lucene query syntax.
- **Simple scoring profiles** that score model relevance as a function of values in the documents themselves.
- **Geo search** that explores data based on the proximity of a search result to a physical location.
- **User experiences features** like autocomplete, suggestions, sorting, and paging.
- **Knowledge store** that saves enrichments created during indexing.
- **Import data wizard** to configure indexers.
- **Index designer** to set up an index.
- **Search explorer** to test queries and refine scoring profiles.
- **Indexing pipeline analysis** to extract text information from raw content for image and text analysis.
- **Data source extraction** to extract searchable content from Azure SQL Database, Azure Cosmos DB, and Azure Blob Storage connected data stores.
