# Quickstart: Create a Python app in Azure App Service 

In this quickstart, you deploy a Python web app to [App Service on Linux](/azure/app-service/overview#app-service-on-linux), Azure's highly scalable, self-patching web hosting service. 

## Getting started

You use the local [Azure command-line interface (CLI)](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) on a Mac, Linux, or Windows computer to deploy a sample with either the Flask or Django frameworks. The web app you configure uses a free <abbr title="An HTTP-based service for hosting web applications, REST APIs, and mobile back-end applications.">App Service</abbr> tier, so you incur no costs in the course of this article.
