[Terraform](https://www.terraform.io) enables the definition, preview, and deployment of cloud infrastructure. Using Terraform, you create configuration files using [HCL syntax](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/syntax.html). The HCL syntax allows you to specify the cloud provider - such as Azure - and the elements that make up your cloud infrastructure. After you create your configuration files, you create an *execution plan* that allows you to preview your infrastructure changes before they're deployed. Once you verify the changes, you apply the execution plan to deploy the infrastructure. For more information about using Terraform in Azure, see the [Azure Terraform developer center](/azure/developer/terraform)
