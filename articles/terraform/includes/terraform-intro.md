[Terraform](https://www.terraform.io) enables the definition, preview, and deployment of cloud infrastructure. Using Terraform, you create configuration files using [HCL syntax](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/syntax.html). The HCL syntax allows you to specify the cloud provider - such as Azure - and the elements that make up your cloud infrastructure. After you create your configuration files, you create an *execution plan* that allows you to preview your infrastructure changes before they're deployed. Once you verify the changes, you apply the execution plan to deploy the infrastructure.
