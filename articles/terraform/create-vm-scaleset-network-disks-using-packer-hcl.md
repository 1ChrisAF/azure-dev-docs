# Create an Azure virtual machine scale set from a Packer custom image by using Terraform

[Azure virtual machine scale sets](/azure/virtual-machine-scale-sets) allow you to configure identical VMs. The number of VM instances can adjust based on demand or a schedule. For more information, see [Automatically scale a virtual machine scale set in the Azure portal](/azure/virtual-machine-scale-sets/virtual-machine-scale-sets-autoscale-portal).

In this article, you learn how to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Set up your Terraform deployment
> * Use variables and outputs for Terraform deployment
> * Create and deploy a network infrastructure
> * Create a custom virtual machine image by using Packer
> * Create and deploy a virtual machine scale set by using the custom image
> * Create and deploy a jumpbox

## 1. Configure your environment

[!INCLUDE [open-source-devops-prereqs-azure-subscription.md](../includes/open-source-devops-prereqs-azure-subscription.md)]

[!INCLUDE [configure-terraform.md](includes/configure-terraform.md)]

- **SSH key pair:** [Create an SSH key pair](/azure/virtual-machines/linux/mac-create-ssh-keys). Make note of where you save the key.

- **Packer:**  [Install Packer](https://learn.hashicorp.com/packer/getting-started/install).

- **Packer image:** Create a custom Linux image by following the steps in the article [How to use Packer to create Linux virtual machine images in Azure](/azure/virtual-machines/linux/build-image-with-packer).

## 2. Implement the Terraform code

1. Create a directory in which to test and run the sample Terraform code.

1. Create your main Terraform configuration file. By convention, the name of this file is `main.tf`. However, you can specify any valid name for your environment.

1. Insert the following code into the main Terraform configuration file.

    [!code-terraform[tarcher-move-sample-code-to-github](../../terraform_samples/quickstart/201-vmss-packer-jumpbox/main.tf)]

1. Create a variables file that will contain the values for Terraform. By convention, the name of this file is `variables.tf`. However, you can specify any valid name for your environment.

1. Insert the following code into the variables file.

    [!code-terraform[tarcher-move-sample-code-to-github](../../terraform_samples/quickstart/201-vmss-packer-jumpbox/variables.tf)]

    [!INCLUDE [variables-terraform-file-key-points.md](includes/variables-terraform-file-key-points.md)]

1. Create a file to specify what values to output when the Terraform plan is applied. By convention, the name of this file is `output.tf`. However, you can specify any valid name for your environment.

    [!code-terraform[tarcher-move-sample-code-to-github](../../terraform_samples/quickstart/201-vmss-packer-jumpbox/output.tf)]

## 3. Initialize Terraform

[!INCLUDE [terraform-init.md](includes/terraform-init.md)]

## 4. Create a Terraform execution plan

[!INCLUDE [terraform-create-plan.md](includes/terraform-create-plan.md)]

## 5. Apply a Terraform execution plan

[!INCLUDE [terraform-apply-plan.md](includes/terraform-apply-plan.md)]

## 6. Verify the results

## 7. Clean up resources

[!INCLUDE [terraform-destroy-plan.md](includes/terraform-destroy-plan.md)]
