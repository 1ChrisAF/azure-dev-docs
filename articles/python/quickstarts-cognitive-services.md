# Cognitive Services for Python apps on Azure

Azure Cognitive Services make extensive AI capabilities easily available to applications in areas such as computer vision and image processing, language analysis and translation, speech, decision-making, and comprehensive search.

Because Azure Cognitive Services continues to evolve, the best way to find getting started material for Python is to begin on the [Azure Cognitive Service hub page](/azure/cognitive-services/). Select a service of interest and then expand the **Quickstarts** node. Under **Quickstarts**, look for subsections about using the client libraries or the REST API. The articles in those subsections include Python where supported.
