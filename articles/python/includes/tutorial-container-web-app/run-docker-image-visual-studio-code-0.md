In the *.vscode* folder of the sample apps, edit the *tasks.json* and *settings.json* file for your situation.

* The *settings.json* file is used to define what happens when you work with the Docker extension UI and select **Run** or **Run Interactive**. Similar to *tasks.json*, there are templates for MongoDB local and MongoDB Azure. For MongoDB local, specify "\<YOUR-IP-ADDRESS>". For MongoDB Azure", specify "\<CONNECTION_STRING>".

* Both the database name and collection name are assumed to be "restaurants_reviews".
