Confirm the image was built.

* Go to the **IMAGES** section of the Docker extension.

* Look for recently built image.  The tag of the container image will be "msdocspythoncontainerwebapp:latest". The name is derived from the name of the project and is automatically selected as well as the "latest" tag. If you want more control over the name, use the Docker build command.
