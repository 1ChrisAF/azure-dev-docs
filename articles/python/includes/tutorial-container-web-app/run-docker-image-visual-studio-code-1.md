Run the image.

* In the **IMAGES** section of the Docker extension, find the built image.

* Expand the image to find the **latest** tag, right-click and select **Run Interactive**.

* You will be prompted to select the task appropriate for your scenario, either "Interactive run configuration (MongoDB local)" or "Interactive run configuration (MongoDB Azure)".

With interactive, you see any print statements in the code, which can be useful for debugging. You can also use **Run** which doesn't keep standard input open.
