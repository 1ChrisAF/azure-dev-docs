Run the image.

* In the **IMAGES** section of the Docker extension, find the image built.
* Expand the image to find the **latest** tag, right-click and select **Run Interactive**.

With interactive, you see any print statements in the code, which can be useful for debugging. You can also use **Run** which doesn't keep standard input open.
