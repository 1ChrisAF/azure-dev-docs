Build the image.

* In the project Explorer, right-click the *Dockerfile* in the project folder and select **Build Image...**.

* Alternately, you can use the Command Palette (**F1** or **Ctrl+Shift+P**) and type "Docker Images: Build Images" to invoke the command.

For more information about Dockerfile syntax, see the [Dockerfile reference](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/).
