# Azure SDK reference - Python

Find the Azure SDK Python overviews, readmes, and client libraries for Azure services.
 
To view the SDK topics for all the services, see the [Python API Browser](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/?view=azure-python). 

> [!NOTE]
> We are piloting a new way to navigate to the Azure SDK reference topics. The new navigation shows the reference topics on a per-service basis instead of showing the entire reference in one table of contents.

## New navigation to client libraries for services

Try the new navigation by using the following table to link to SDK topics per service.  We will continue adding more services to this list.

| Service | Client libraries |
| ---- | ---- |
| [Storage](./storage/overview.md) | Storage Blob, Storage File Share, Storage Queue, and Management. |

## We want to hear from you

Please provide feedback on this page to let us know how you like the new navigation experience to the Storage reference topics.
