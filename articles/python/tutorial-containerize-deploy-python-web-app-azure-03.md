# Build and test a containerized Python web app in the cloud

This article is part of a tutorial about containerizing and deploy a Python web app to Azure App Service. App Service enables you to run containerized web apps and deploy through continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) capabilities with Docker Hub, Azure Container Registry, and Visual Studio Team Services. In this part of the tutorial, you learn how to build and run the containerized Python web app locally.

In the previous part of this tutorial, a container image was build and run locally. In this part of the tutorial, you will build (containerize) a Python web app into a Docker image in the cloud, in [Azure Container Registry](/azure/container-registry/container-registry-intro). Building in the close which has the advantage of typically being faster and easier.

## 1. Add an Azure Container Registry

If you have an Azure Container Registry, go to the next step.

### [Azure portal](#tab/azure-portal)

### [VS Code](#tab/vscode-aztools)

### [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

## 2. Build image in Azure

### [Azure portal](#tab/azure-portal)

### [VS Code](#tab/vscode-aztools)

### [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)
