# Troubleshooting Dependency Version Conflicts

Azure SDKs depend on several popular third-party libraries: [Jackson](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson), [Netty](https://netty.io/), [Reactor](https://projectreactor.io/), [SLF4J](http://www.slf4j.org/).

Many Java applications and frameworks use these libraries directly or transitively, which leads to version conflicts. To resolve version conflict happens, package manager picks a single version, which is may be incompatible with some components. Check out [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-dependency-mechanism.html) and [Gradle](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/dependency_resolution.html) documentation for dependency version resolution.

When an incompatibility is encountered, it results in a runtime failure such as [NoClassDefFoundError](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/NoClassDefFoundError.html), [NoSuchMethodError](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/NoSuchMethodError.html), or other [LinkageError](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/LinkageError.html). Not all libraries strictly follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) and breaking changes sometimes happen within the same major version.

## Troubleshooting

### Diagnosing version mismatch issues

#### Dependency tree

Run `mvn dependency:tree` or `gradle dependencies â€” scan` to show full dependency tree with versions. (Note: `mvn dependency:tree -Dverbose` gives more information, but [may  be misleading](https://maven.apache.org/shared/maven-dependency-tree/)). Notice versions of library you suspect has version conflict and check which components depend on it.

Dependency resolution in development and production environments may work differently. Here are some known environments with custom dependency resolution and may need extra configuration. Check out corresponding project dependency management documentation.

- [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/submitting-applications.html#bundling-your-applications-dependencies)
- [Apache Flink](https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-release-1.13/docs/dev/datastream/project-configuration/)
- [Databricks](https://kb.databricks.com/libraries/maven-library-version-mgmt.html)
- IDE plugins

#### Azure Functions (Java 8) configuration

Internal dependency version on Azure Functions (running Java 8 only) takes precedence over user-provided one - it causes version conflicts especially with Jackson, Netty, and Reactor.

**Solution**: set `FUNCTIONS_WORKER_JAVA_LOAD_APP_LIBS` environment variable to `true` or `1`. Make sure to update Azure Function Tools (v2 or v3) to latest version.

#### Jackson runtime version detection

In Azure Core 1.21.0, we added runtime detection and better diagnostics of Jackson version.

- For `LinkageError` (or any of its subclasses) exceptions related to Jackson API, check message of the exception for runtime version information.</br>Example: `com.azure.core.implementation.jackson.JacksonVersionMismatchError: com/fasterxml/jackson/databind/cfg/MapperBuilder Package versions: jackson-annotations=2.9.0, jackson-core=2.9.0, jackson-databind=2.9.0, jackson-dataformat-xml=2.9.0, jackson-datatype-jsr310=2.9.0, azure-core=1.19.0-beta.2`

- Look for warning/error [logs](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/developer/java/sdk/logging-overview) from `JacksonVersion`.</br>Example: `[main] ERROR com.azure.core.implementation.jackson.JacksonVersion - Version '2.9.0' of package 'jackson-core' is not supported (too old), please upgrade.`

### Mitigation

#### Use Azure SDK BOM

Use latest stable [Azure SDK BOM](https://search.maven.org/artifact/com.azure/azure-sdk-bom) and don't specify versions on Azure SDKs and their dependencies in your POM file. When applicable, make sure you're also using [Azure Spring Boot BOM](https://search.maven.org/artifact/com.azure.spring/azure-spring-boot-bom/). Using Azure BOMs avoids version conflicts within Azure ecosystem and between Azure ecosystem and application.

#### Adjust library versions

If issue persists after switching to latest BOM, identify libraries causing conflict (see [Dependency tree](#dependency-tree)). If possible, update their version to avoid conflict. Avoid downgrading Azure SDK version to match dependency versions - it may expose your application to known vulnerabilities and bugs.

#### Shade

Sometimes there's no combination of libraries that work together. In this case, you may create a single 'shaded JAR' file including the library and all its dependencies, with the packages renamed into a different namespace to avoid conflicts.

You may shade library that has conflicting transitive dependency or direct application dependency:

1. **Transitive dependency conflict**: for example, third-party library `A` requires Jackson 2.9, which is not supported by Azure SDKs, and it's not possible to update `A`. Create a new JAR, which includes `A` and shades Jackson 2.9 (you may include other dependencies in the same package).
2. **Application dependency conflict**: your application uses Jackson 2.9 directly and while you're working on updating you code, you can shade Jackson 2.9. Check out the example below.

**Note**: shading Jackson into application JAR doesn't resolve version conflict - it only forces single shaded version of Jackson.

Example of shading Jackson libraries under a new JAR with Maven:

- Use [Maven Shade Plugin](https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-shade-plugin/).
- Create a new package that would wrap or Jackson libraries themselves if your application needs older version
- Configure shading plugin:

```xml
<plugin>
<groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
<artifactId>maven-shade-plugin</artifactId>
<version>${maven-shade-plugin-version}</version>
<executions>
    <execution>
        <phase>package</phase>
        <goals>
            <goal>shade</goal>
        </goals>
        <configuration>
            <!--Create shaded JAR only-->
            <shadedArtifactAttached>false</shadedArtifactAttached>
            <!--Remove original replaced dependencies-->
            <createDependencyReducedPom>true</createDependencyReducedPom>
            <!--Promotes transitive dependencies of removed dependencies to direct-->
            <promoteTransitiveDependencies>true</promoteTransitiveDependencies>
            <artifactSet>
                <includes>
                    <include>com.fasterxml.jackson:*</include>
                    <include>com.fasterxml.jackson.*:*</include>
                </includes>
            </artifactSet>
            <relocations>
                <relocation>
                    <pattern>com.fasterxml.jackson</pattern>
                    <shadedPattern>org.example.shaded.com.fasterxml.jackson</shadedPattern>
                    <includes>
                        <include>com.fasterxml.jackson.**</include>
                    </includes>
                </relocation>
            </relocations>
        </configuration>
    </execution>
</executions>
</plugin>
```

- Run `mvn package` to create a Jackson wrapper JAR file: it doesn't depend on original Jackson, instead it includes renamed Jackson packages and classes. Make sure to update namespaces in your application code to `org.example.shaded.com.fasterxml.jackson.*` (or other prefix of your choice).

## Compatible dependency versions

Refer to [Maven](https://search.maven.org/artifact/com.azure/azure-core/) for details on `azure-core` specific dependencies and their versions. Here are some general considerations:

| Dependency | Supported versions |
| ---------- | ------------------ |
| Jackson    | 2.10.0 or newer minor versions are compatible. |
| SLF4J      | 1.7.* |
| netty-tcnative-boringssl-static | 2.0.* |
| netty-common | 4.1.* |
| reactor-core | 3.X.\*, *Major, and minor* versions have to match exactly ones your `azure-core` version depends upon - refer to [Project Reactor breaking change policy](https://github.com/reactor/.github/blob/main/SUPPORT.adoc#our-policy-on-deprecations) |
