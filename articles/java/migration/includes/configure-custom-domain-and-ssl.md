### Configure custom domain and SSL

If your application will be visible on a custom domain, you'll need to map your web application to it. For more information, see [Tutorial: Map an existing custom DNS name to Azure App Service](/azure/app-service/app-service-web-tutorial-custom-domain).

Then, you'll need to bind the SSL certificate for that domain to your App Service Web App. For more information, see [Secure a custom DNS name with an SSL binding in Azure App Service](/azure/app-service/app-service-web-tutorial-custom-ssl).
