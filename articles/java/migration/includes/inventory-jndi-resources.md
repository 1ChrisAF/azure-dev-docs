### Inventory JNDI resources

Inventory all JNDI resources. For example, datasources such as databases may have an associated JNDI name that allows JPA to correctly bind instances of `EntityManager` to a particular database. For more information on JNDI resources and databases, see [WebLogic Server Data Sources](https://docs.oracle.com/en/middleware/fusion-middleware/weblogic-server/12.2.1.4/intro/jdbc.html) in the Oracle documentation. Other JNDI-related resources, such as JMS message brokers, may require migration or reconfiguration. For more information on JMS configuration see [Understanding JMS Resource Configuration](https://docs.oracle.com/en/middleware/fusion-middleware/weblogic-server/12.2.1.4/jmsad/overview.html).
