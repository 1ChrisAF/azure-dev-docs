## Prepare the working environment

First, set up some environment variables by using the following commands:

```bash
AZ_RESOURCE_GROUP=database-workshop
AZ_DATABASE_NAME=<YOUR_DATABASE_NAME>
AZ_LOCATION=<YOUR_AZURE_REGION>
AZ_MYSQL_USERNAME=spring
AZ_MYSQL_PASSWORD=<YOUR_MYSQL_PASSWORD>
AZ_LOCAL_IP_ADDRESS=<YOUR_LOCAL_IP_ADDRESS>
```

Replace the placeholders with the following values, which are used throughout this article:

- `<YOUR_DATABASE_NAME>`: The name of your MySQL server. It should be unique across Azure.
- `<YOUR_AZURE_REGION>`: The Azure region you'll use. You can use `eastus` by default, but we recommend that you configure a region closer to where you live. You can have the full list of available regions by entering `az account list-locations`.
- `<YOUR_MYSQL_PASSWORD>`: The password of your MySQL database server. That password should have a minimum of eight characters. The characters should be from three of the following categories: English uppercase letters, English lowercase letters, numbers (0-9), and non-alphanumeric characters (!, $, #, %, and so on).
- `<YOUR_LOCAL_IP_ADDRESS>`: The IP address of your local computer, from which you'll run your Spring Boot application. One convenient way to find it is to point your browser to [whatismyip.akamai.com](http://whatismyip.akamai.com/).

Next, create a resource group:

```azurecli
az group create \
    --name $AZ_RESOURCE_GROUP \
    --location $AZ_LOCATION \
    --output tsv
```

## Create an Azure Database for MySQL instance

The first thing we'll create is a managed MySQL server.

> [!NOTE]
> You can read more detailed information about creating MySQL servers in [Create an Azure Database for MySQL server by using the Azure portal](/azure/mysql/quickstart-create-mysql-server-database-using-azure-portal).

In [Azure Cloud Shell](https://shell.azure.com/), run the following script:

```azurecli
az mysql server create \
    --resource-group $AZ_RESOURCE_GROUP \
    --name $AZ_DATABASE_NAME \
    --location $AZ_LOCATION \
    --sku-name B_Gen5_1 \
    --storage-size 5120 \
    --admin-user $AZ_MYSQL_USERNAME \
    --admin-password $AZ_MYSQL_PASSWORD \
    --output tsv
```

This command creates a small MySQL server.

### Configure a firewall rule for your MySQL server

Azure Database for MySQL instances are secured by default. They have a firewall that doesn't allow any incoming connection. To be able to use your database, you need to add a firewall rule that will allow the local IP address to access the database server.

Because you configured your local IP address at the beginning of this article, you can open the server's firewall by running the following command:

```azurecli
az mysql server firewall-rule create \
    --resource-group $AZ_RESOURCE_GROUP \
    --name $AZ_DATABASE_NAME-database-allow-local-ip \
    --server $AZ_DATABASE_NAME \
    --start-ip-address $AZ_LOCAL_IP_ADDRESS \
    --end-ip-address $AZ_LOCAL_IP_ADDRESS \
    --output tsv
```

If you're connecting to your MySQL server from WSL on a Windows computer, you'll need to add the WSL host ID to your firewall.

Obtain the IP address of your host machine by running the following command in WSL:

```bash
cat /etc/resolv.conf
```

Copy the IP address following the term `nameserver`, then use the following command to set an environment variable for the WSL IP Address:

```bash
AZ_WSL_IP_ADDRESS=<the-copied-IP-address>
```

Then, use the following command to open the server's firewall to your WSL-based app:

```azurecli
az mysql server firewall-rule create \
    --resource-group $AZ_RESOURCE_GROUP \
    --name $AZ_DATABASE_NAME-database-allow-local-ip \
    --server $AZ_DATABASE_NAME \
    --start-ip-address $AZ_WSL_IP_ADDRESS \
    --end-ip-address $AZ_WSL_IP_ADDRESS \
    --output tsv
```

### Configure a MySQL database

The MySQL server that you created earlier is empty. It doesn't have any database that you can use with the Spring Boot application. Create a new database called `demo` by using the following command:

```azurecli
az mysql db create \
    --resource-group $AZ_RESOURCE_GROUP \
    --name demo \
    --server-name $AZ_DATABASE_NAME \
    --output tsv
```
