## Prerequisites

- An Azure account. If you don't have one, [get a free trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
- [Azure Cloud Shell](/azure/cloud-shell/quickstart) or [Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli). We recommend Azure Cloud Shell so you'll be logged in automatically and have access to all the tools you'll need.
- [Java 8](https://www.azul.com/downloads/zulu/) (included in Azure Cloud Shell).
- [cURL](https://curl.haxx.se) or similar HTTP utility to test functionality.
