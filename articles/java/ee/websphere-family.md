# What are solutions to run the IBM WebSphere family of products on Azure?

This article describes the solutions for running the IBM WebSphere family of products on Azure. These solutions are jointly developed and supported by IBM and Microsoft.

The IBM WebSphere product portfolio is a set of industry-leading runtimes powering some of the most mission critical enterprise applications across geographies and environments. The WebSphere portfolio includes WebSphere (Traditional) Application Server, WebSphere Liberty, and Open Liberty.

WebSphere products are key components in enabling enterprise Java workloads on Azure. The jointly developed solutions aim to cover a range of use cases from mission critical existing traditional workloads to cloud-native applications. The solutions target Open Liberty on Azure Red Hat OpenShift (ARO), WebSphere Liberty on ARO, WebSphere Application Server on Virtual Machines, Open Liberty on the Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), and WebSphere Liberty on AKS. The solutions are aimed at making it as easy as possible to migrate your application to the cloud by automating most boilerplate Azure and Java resource provisioning and configuration tasks. Once initial provisioning is done, you're completely free to customize deployments further. Some examples of further customizations include integration with databases (Db2, Azure SQL, Azure PostgreSQL, Azure MySQL), Azure App Gateway, Azure Active Directory, and ELK.

## Open Liberty and WebSphere Liberty on ARO

This offer automatically provisions several Azure resources to quickly move to WebSphere Liberty or Open Liberty on ARO. The automatically provisioned resources include virtual networks, an ARO cluster, along with the OpenShift Container Registry (OCR), and the Liberty Operator. A secure OpenShift project is set up to contain your application. The offer can also deploy a Docker image including Open Liberty or WebSphere Liberty. The offer is available as an [Azure solution template in the Portal](https://portal.azure.com/#create/ibm-usa-ny-armonk-hq-6275750-ibmcloud-aiops.20210823-liberty-aroliberty-aro). The solution also includes basic step-by-step guidance on getting started with [Open Liberty/WebSphere Liberty and ARO](/azure/openshift/howto-deploy-java-liberty-app). This guidance is intended for customers that would prefer a native OpenShift manual deployment experience instead of automated provisioning using the solution template.

## WebSphere Application Server on VMs

This offer automatically provisions several Azure resources to quickly move to WebSphere (Traditional) Application Server on Azure VMs. The automatically provisioned resources include virtual network, storage, network security group, Java, Linux, and WebSphere. With minimal effort you can provision a fully functional, highly available WebSphere Network Deployment cluster including the Deployment Manager and any number of servers you need. You can also have the offer provision and configure the IBM HTTP Server as a load-balancer. The Deployment Manager and all servers are started by default, which allows you to begin managing the cluster right away using the Admin Console. The offer is available as an [Azure solution template in the Portal](https://portal.azure.com/#create/ibm-usa-ny-armonk-hq-6275750-ibmcloud-aiops.2021-04-08-twas-clustercluster).

## Open Liberty and WebSphere Liberty on AKS

This offer automatically provisions several Azure resources to quickly move to WebSphere Liberty or Open Liberty on AKS. The automatically provisioned resources include the Azure Container Registry (ACR), an AKS cluster and the Liberty Operator. The offer can also deploy a Docker image including Open Liberty or WebSphere Liberty. The offer is available as an [Azure solution template in the Portal](https://portal.azure.com/#create/ibm-usa-ny-armonk-hq-6275750-ibmcloud-aiops.20210924-liberty-aksliberty-aks). The solution also includes basic step-by-step guidance on getting started with [Open Liberty/WebSphere Liberty and AKS](/azure/aks/howto-deploy-java-liberty-app). This guidance is intended for customers that would prefer a native Kubernetes manual deployment experience instead of automated provisioning using the solution template.
