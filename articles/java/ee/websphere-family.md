# What are solutions to run the IBM WebSphere family of products on Azure?

This article describes the solutions for running the IBM WebSphere family of products on Azure. These solutions are jointly developed and supported by IBM and Microsoft.

The IBM WebSphere product portfolio is a set of industry-leading runtimes powering some of the most mission critical enterprise applications across geographies and environments. The WebSphere portfolio includes WebSphere (Traditional) Application Server, WebSphere Liberty, and Open Liberty.

WebSphere products are key components in enabling enterprise Java workloads on Azure. The offers aim to cover a range of use cases from mission critical existing traditional workloads to cloud-native applications. The offers target Open Liberty on Azure Red Hat OpenShift (ARO), WebSphere Liberty on ARO, WebSphere Application Server on Virtual Machines, Open Liberty on the Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), and WebSphere Liberty on AKS. All offers enable further customization of deployments such as integration with databases (Db2, Azure SQL, Azure PostgreSQL, Azure MySQL), Azure App Gateway, Azure Active Directory, and ELK.

The currently available offers are linked at the bottom of this page.

## Open Liberty and WebSphere Liberty on ARO

This offer is aimed at automatically provisioning several Azure resources to quickly move to Open Liberty and WebSphere Liberty on ARO. The automatically provisioned resources include virtual networks, storage, ARO, the Open Liberty Operator, container registries, namespaces, Docker images, and Open Liberty/WebSphere Liberty. The solution also includes basic step-by-step guidance on getting started with Open Liberty/WebSphere Liberty and ARO, remaining as close as possible to a native OpenShift experience. For more information, see [Deploy a Java application with Open Liberty or WebSphere Liberty on an Azure Red Hat OpenShift (ARO) cluster](/azure/openshift/howto-deploy-java-liberty-app).

## WebSphere Application Server on VMs

This offer is aimed at automatically provisioning several Azure resources to quickly move to WebSphere (Traditional) Application Server on Azure Virtual Machines. The automatically provisioned resources include virtual network, storage, network security group, Java, Linux, and WebSphere. The offer targets highly available WebSphere clusters. The offer is available as an [Azure solution template in the Portal](https://portal.azure.com/#create/ibm-usa-ny-armonk-hq-6275750-ibmcloud-aiops.2021-04-08-twas-clustercluster).
