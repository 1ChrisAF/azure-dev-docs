# Hosting applications on Azure

Azure provides a variety of different ways to host your app depending on your needs.  


## Server side web apps and APIs

For server-side web apps or APIs in .NET (ASP.NET, ASP.NET Core), JavaScript (Express.js), or Python (Django, Flask, Fast API), Azure App Service provides a fully-managed, platform as a service hosting solution.  


## Static Web Apps

## Microservices




For Spring Boot microservices, Azure Spring Cloud provides a managed service that makes it easy to run these services in Azure.  No code changes are required to run these services in Azure. The service manages the infrastructure of Spring Cloud applications so developers can focus on their code. Azure Spring Cloud provides lifecycle management using comprehensive monitoring and diagnostics, configuration management, service discovery, CI/CD integration, blue-green deployments, and more.
