# Hosting applications on Azure

Azure provides a variety of different ways to host your app depending on your needs.  

## Azure App Service

Azure App Service is the fastest and easiest way to host web applications and APIs in Azure.  Azure App Service provides a fully-managed, platform as a service hosting solution that supports .NET, Java, JavaScript, and Python applications.  Hosting options are available on both Windows and Linux depending on the application runtime.

Azure App Service supports autoscaling, high-availability,

Azure App Service has been designed with DevOps in mind. It supports various tools for publishing and continuous integration deployments. These tools include GitHub webhooks, Jenkins, Azure DevOps, TeamCity, and others.

## Static Web Apps



## Azure Functions

Rather than worrying about building out and managing a whole application or the infrastructure to run your code, what if you could just write your code and have it run in response to events or on a schedule? Azure Functions is a "serverless"-style offering that lets you write just the code you need. With Functions, you can trigger code execution with HTTP requests, webhooks, cloud service events, or on a schedule. You can code in your development language of choice, such as C#, F#, Node.js, Python, or PHP. With consumption-based billing, you pay only for the time that your code executes, and Azure scales as needed.


## Azure Spring Cloud



## Azure Batch



## Azure Virtual Machines

Azure Virtual Machines provide an Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) solution for hosting your applications on either Windows or Linux VMs in the cloud. With Azure Virtual Machines, you have total control over the configuration of the machine. When using VMs, you're responsible for all server software installation, configuration, maintenance, and operating system patches.

Because of the level of control that you have with VMs, you can run a wide range of server workloads on Azure that don't fit into a PaaS model. For more information, see the [Virtual Machines documentation](/azure/virtual-machines/).










## Microservices




For Spring Boot microservices, Azure Spring Cloud provides a managed service that makes it easy to run these services in Azure.  No code changes are required to run these services in Azure. The service manages the infrastructure of Spring Cloud applications so developers can focus on their code. Azure Spring Cloud provides lifecycle management using comprehensive monitoring and diagnostics, configuration management, service discovery, CI/CD integration, blue-green deployments, and more.



## Containerized applications


## Kubernetes



## Serverless applications


## Batch applications













## Server side web apps and APIs

For server-side web apps or APIs in .NET (ASP.NET, ASP.NET Core), JavaScript (Express.js), or Python (Django, Flask, FastAPI), Azure App Service provides a fully-managed, platform as a service hosting solution.
