# Create and use MongoDB on Azure with Cosmos DB

A Cosmos DB resource provides you with a MongoDB to use with MongoDB provider packages found on npm. 

Cosmos DB is a fully-managed, geo-replicable, high-performance, NoSQL database that provides a MongoDB-compatibility layer. You can point an existing JavaScript app at it (or any MongoDB client/tool) without needing to change anything but the connection string.
