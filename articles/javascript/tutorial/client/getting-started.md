# JavaScript client applications on Azure

Learn fundamental concepts to develop, build, deploy, and troubleshoot client applications hosted on Azure. 

## Develop client applications for the browser

Developing client applications for Azure can mean a few different things:

* **Hosting** a client application, such as a React app, on Azure. 
* **Authenticating and authorizing** your users with the Microsoft Identity provider. 
* **Integrating** Azure services, such as CosmosDB or Azure Storage from the client app.

While the specifics of each piece are different from other cloud providers, the general process and end result are similar to other cloud providers. The following local develop settings help you develop your apps faster with fewer errors or issues:

* Your minimum and maximum Node.js version. Verify your Node.js version choice is supported for your hosting platform and Azure SDK dependencies.  
* Develop your code and build processes to run independently from your environment. You should be able to get your client application from source control, install required dependencies, build and run from a known base image. 


## Build tools and processes for local and remote builds

## Deploy your client application to an Azure hosting platform

## Troubleshoot your Azure-hosted client application

## Analyze your client application
