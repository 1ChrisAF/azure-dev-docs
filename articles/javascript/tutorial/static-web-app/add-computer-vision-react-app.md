# 6. Review how to add Computer Vision to the React app

This sample has all the TypeScript code necessary to add Computer Vision to the React App. This section of the tutorial _reviews_ the steps and code. You do not need to take these steps for this tutorial.

## Add Computer Vision to local React app

Use npm to add Computer Vision to the package.json file. 

```bash
npm install @azure/cognitiveservices-computervision 
```

## Add Computer Vision code as separate module

The Computer Vision code is contained in a separate file named `./src/azure-cognitiveservices-computervision.js`. The main function of the module is highlighted.
