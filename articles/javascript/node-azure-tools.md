# Tools for JavaScript developers on Azure 

JavaScript is an ecosystem of many tools. This article is a selection of tools built and maintained by Microsoft for JavaScript developers. Tools improve for new Azure Services and deploy/hosting scenarios. 

You don't need to use these tools to use Azure, it just makes the experience much better, both in functionality and support. 

## Azure portal

The [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) gives you access to all subscriptions and resources for your account. 

## Azure CLI
Azure CLI is optimized for managing Azure resources from the command line. 

Azure CLI provides the following use scenarios:

* [Azure CLI Local installation](/cli/azure/install-az-cli2)
* [Azure Cloud shell](https://shell.azure.com/)
* [Docker container](/cli/azure/run-azure-cli-docker)

If you use the Azure portal, the Azure CLI is available in the portal from the top navigation bar.

## TypeScript

[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/download) offers all of JavaScript’s features, and an additional layer on top of these: TypeScript’s type system. Your existing working JavaScript code is also TypeScript code. The main benefit of TypeScript is that it can highlight unexpected behavior in your code, lowering the chance of bugs.

## TypeScript and the Azure SDK client libraries

Azure SDK client library reference documentation is written for TypeScript because the client libraries are written with TypeScript. You don't have to use TypeScript to use the Azure SDK client libraries. 

Learn more about the [TypeScript guidelines for Azure SDK](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/typescript_introduction.html).

## Visual Studio Code

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) is the preferred IDE for JavaScript development for Azure. The interface, features, and extensions work together to shorten development time and reduce development frustration. 

Create a project workspace at the root of your local development project then add all relevant configurations, settings, and extensions. Check in the workspace file with the project so every team member has access to the settings and tools they need for the project.

You get several benefits using Visual Studio Code:

* Visual Studio Code displays the Azure reference documentation inline
* Visual Studio Code provides statement completion
* Few ambiguous types or objects

Visual Studio code provides of wealth of documentation for [JavaScript project use](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/nodejs/working-with-javascript). 

## Visual Studio Code Extensions
Use the following free extensions to interface with Azure services directly in Visual Studio Code.
