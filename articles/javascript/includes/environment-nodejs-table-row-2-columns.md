|[Node.js 10+](https://www.npmjs.com/)|Install latest long-term support (LTS) runtime environment for local workstation development. A package manager is also required. Node.js installs NPM in the 10.x version. The Azure SDK generally requires a minimum version of Node.js of 10.x. Azure hosting services, such as Azure App service, provides runtimes with more recent versions of Node.js. If you target a minimum of 10.x for local and remote development, your code should run successfully.|
