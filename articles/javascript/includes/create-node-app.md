Create and run an Express.js app by cloning an Azure sample repository. 

1. At a terminal command prompt, go to the location where you want to create the app folder.

1. Use the following base command with git to clone the repository, change into the repository folder named `myexpressapp`, then install the npm dependencies. 

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/js-e2e-express-server.git myexpressapp && \
        cd myexpressapp && \
        npm install
    ```
