1. Click on the Azure icon on the left navigation and expand the subscriptions to find the App Service you created previously.  

1. Right click on the App Service node and select *Deploy to Web App*.

1. A prompt will appear to select the folder to deploy.  If root of the project is already suggested, choose that option, otherwise click the `Browse` button to select the root folder from the file explorer. If VS Code prompts you to add configuration files to your project, accept these changes and the app will begin to deploy to Azure.

After the deployment completes you should see a VS Code notification prompting you to browse to the deployed app.
