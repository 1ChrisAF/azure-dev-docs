Click on the Azure icon on the left navigation and expand the subscriptions to find the App Service you created previously.  Right click on the App Service node and select *Deploy to Web App*.

VS Code may prompt you to add some configuration files to your project. Accept these changes, and the app will begin to deploy.

After the deployment completes you should see a VS Code notification prompting you to browse to the deployed app.
