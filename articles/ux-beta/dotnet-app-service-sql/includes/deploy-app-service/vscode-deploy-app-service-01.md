In your VS Code environment, verify that the Azure Account and Azure App Service extensions are installed.  Ensure you are logged into your Azure Account using the Account extension.

If you are not already logged in through the Azure Account extension, you can do so using `Ctrl + Shift + P` to open the VS Code Command Palette.  From there you can type `Azure: Sign In` and then hit enter to launch a browser window that will log you in.
