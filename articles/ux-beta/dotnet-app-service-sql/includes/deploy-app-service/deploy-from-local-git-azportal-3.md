After saving, on the Deployment Center page:

1) Navigate to the Local Git/FTPS credentials tab.
2) Locate the username and password under the Application Scope credentials.
3) Keep this screen open or copy these credentials to use momentarily when you deploy your code to the remote repository.
4) NOTE: You will only need the part of the username starting with $ onward for authenticating via the Git prompt.

When you push code to the remote Git repository for the first time, these credentials are needed to authenticate to the remote repository.
