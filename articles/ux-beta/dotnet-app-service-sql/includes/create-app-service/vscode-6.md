The next dialog box allows you to select the **App Service plan** for your web app.  The App Service plan controls how many resources (CPU/memory) are available to your app and the cost of those resources. You can learn more about choosing an App Service plan in the article [App Service plan overview](/azure/app-service/overview-hosting-plans). For a full list of App Service plans, view the [App Service pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/app-service/windows/) page.

For this example, select the *Free (F1)* plan.

When finished, VS Code will create your web app in Azure.  This process usually takes 1 minute or less.
