Next let's retrieve the database Connection String, which provides the necessary configuration values for our web app to connect to the database.

After the database has been created, click `Go to Resource` on the confirmation page to browser to your database settings.  You can also search for `coreDB` using the main Azure Portal search bar at the top.

On the left navigation of the database settings page, click `Connection strings`.

Under the preselected ADO.NET tab, copy the connection string out of the text box and save it somewhere for later use when we connect our web app.
