On the Create Database page, fill out the form as follows.
1. For the Resource Group, choose the same resource group from the dropdown list as you used for your web app in App Service (msdocs-azure-app-sql-quickstart). This logically groups together all of the components needed for this application together in the same resource group for easier discoverability and management.

1. Enter a database name of coreDb.

1. For the Server, enter a name of globally unique name, such as `coreDBServerXYZ` where XYZ are random numbers.

1. Leave the rest of the settings at their default, and then click Review + create.

1. Azure will take a moment to validate your settings.  Click the Create button once it's enabled, and Azure will begin provisioning your database.  This process may take a few minutes.
