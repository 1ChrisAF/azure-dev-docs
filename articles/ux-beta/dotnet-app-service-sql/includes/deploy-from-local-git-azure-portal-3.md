After saving, on the Deployment Center page:

1) Navigate to the Local Git/FTPS credentials tab.
2) Locate the **Git Clone URI**,  **Username** and **Password** fields under the Application Scope credentials.
3) Keep this screen open or copy these credentials to use momentarily when you deploy your code to the remote repository.
4) NOTE: You will only need the part of the username starting with $ onward for authenticating via the Git prompt.

When you push code to the remote Git repository for the first time, these credentials are needed to authenticate.
