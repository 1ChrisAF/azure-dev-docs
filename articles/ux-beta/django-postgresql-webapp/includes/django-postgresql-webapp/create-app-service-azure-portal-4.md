**Step 4.** Under *App Service Plan*, select **Change size** under *Sku and size setting* to select a different App Service plan.

The App Service plan controls how many resources (CPU/memory) are available to your app and the cost of those resources.<br>
<br>
For this example, select *Dev / Test* at the top of the screen and then select the B1 (Basic) plan.  The B1 Basic plan will incur a small charge against your Azure account but is recommended for better performance over the F1 (Free) plan.<br>
<br>
When finished, select *Apply* to apply your changes.
