In the  **Speck Picker** section, select an App Service plan.

1. Select **Dev/Test**.

1. Select **B1** (Basic) Plan.

    The B1 Basic plan will incur a small charge against your Azure account but is recommended for better performance over the F1 (Free) plan.

1. Select **Apply**.

The App Service plan controls how many resources (CPU/memory) are available to your app and the cost of those resources.
