**Step 5.** Under **Compute + storage**, select **Configure server** to select a different Compute + storage plan.

The **Compute + storage** plan controls how many resources (CPU/memory/storage) are available to your database and the cost of those resources.<br>
<br>
For this example, select **Basic** at the top of the screen and then scale **vCore** down to *1 vCore* and **Storage** down to *5 GB*.  The Basic plan will incur a small charge against your Azure account.<br>
<br>
When finished, select **OK** to apply your changes.
